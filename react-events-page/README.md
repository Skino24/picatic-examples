# Picatic API Event Page - Built with React

This project is an event page with data pulled from the Picatic Ticketing API.

Built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), a global command-line utility used to create React projects.

#### Demo

# Getting Started

**1. Download Dependencies:**

`npm install`

**2. Run app in development mode:**

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template.

* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack won't see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.
